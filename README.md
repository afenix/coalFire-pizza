# Coal Fire Pizza app
This JavaScript/JQuery app allows users to pretend to order a delicious pizza.  Yes it's cruel, but so is the world sometimes.  Users enter what size of pizza they want, the flavor (i.e. cheese or pepperoni), and the style. After submitting these tongue tantalizaing options they are then notified how many slices they do NOT get to eat.
## Setup Instructions:
```
Clone this lovely repository and open the coalFire-pizza.html file.
```
