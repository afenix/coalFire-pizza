# Coal Fire Pizza app
This JavaScript/JQuery app allows users to pretend to order a pizza.  Yes, it's cruel, but so is the world sometimes.  Users enter what size of pizza they want, , the flavor (i.e. cheese or pepperoni) and then are notified how many slices they do not get to eat.
## Setup Instructions:
```
Clone repository and open the coalFire-pizza.html file.
```
